| formulate a loss-function ad hoc, mapping
data to predictions/decisions. Then carefully
analyse to show that, under some external as-
sumptions, this model has certain desirable
properties | Carefully formulate and critique a generative
model. Inference is then uniquely determined
by Bayes’ theorem. No need to question or
analyse the paradigm over and over again |
